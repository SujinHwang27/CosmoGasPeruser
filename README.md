# CosmoGasPeruser

**CosmoGasPeruser** is a project focused on modeling and analyzing the diffuse gas in the universe using machine learning techniques, cosmological simulations, and quasar absorption lines. This repository provides tools to explore and understand the physical properties of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas by leveraging data from state-of-the-art simulations and observational quasar spectra.

Features
- **Cosmological Simulations Integration**: Analyze and extract information from leading simulations such as IllustrisTNG and Sherwood.
- **Quasar Absorption Line Analysis**: Study Lyman-alpha and metal-line absorption features to probe the properties of diffuse gas.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employ advanced machine learning algorithms to predict and interpret gas properties, such as temperature, density, and metallicity, along lines of sight.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate intuitive plots and visualizations of cosmic gas properties and their distribution.

## Motivation
The universe's diffuse gas, particularly in the intergalactic and circumgalactic media, plays a crucial role in cosmic evolution. Quasar absorption lines provide a unique window into this diffuse matter, while cosmological simulations offer detailed predictions for its behavior. **CosmoGasPeruser** aims to bridge these datasets by leveraging machine learning to uncover deeper insights.
